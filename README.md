# PetPy
When away, make sure your pet [fish, cat, dog] never goes hungry with this remote activated feeder/treat dispenser.

## How it works:

The feeder receives a HTTP signal through a browser HTML page to activte the servo. A food container [with a small hole in its side] is attached to the servo and when the it turns, a few pellets/kibble/treats drop into the bowl. You can adjust the hole and size of the container accordingly depending on whether you are feeding a cat, dog, or fish.

Note that I have little to no HTML, CSS, and Javascript experience so they can definitely be improved.

The standard GitHub repos aren't web hosting servers so I use the pages.github.com to server the style.css and the script.js as external files instead of having them embedded into the Python script.
